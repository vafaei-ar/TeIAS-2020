The time elapsed on each question in milliseconds was also recorded.

These other durations were also recorded (measured on the server side):

introelapse		The time spent on the introduction/landing page (in seconds)
testelapse		The time spent on all the DASS questions (should be equivalent to the time elapsed on all the indiviudal questions combined)
surveyelapse	The time spent answering the rest of the demographic and survey questions

On the next page was a generic demographics survey with many different questions.

The Ten Item Personality Inventory was administered (see Gosling, S. D., Rentfrow, P. J., & Swann, W. B., Jr. (2003). A Very Brief Measure of the Big Five Personality Domains. Journal of Research in Personality, 37, 504-528.):

TIPI2	      Critical, quarrelsome.
TIPI3   	Dependable, self-disciplined.
TIPI4	      Anxious, easily upset.
TIPI5	      Open to new experiences, complex.
TIPI6	      Reserved, quiet.
TIPI7	      Sympathetic, warm.
TIPI8	      Disorganized, careless.
TIPI9	      Calm, emotionally stable.
TIPI10	Conventional, uncreative.

The TIPI items were rated "I see myself as: _____" such that

1 = Disagree strongly
2 = Disagree moderately
3 = Disagree a little
4 = Neither agree nor disagree
5 = Agree a little
6 = Agree moderately
7 = Agree strongly



The following items were presented as a check-list and subjects were instructed "In the grid below, check all the words whose definitions you are sure you know":

VCL1	boat
VCL2	incoherent
VCL3	pallid
VCL4	robot
VCL5	audible

VCL13	abysmal
VCL14	lucid
VCL15	betray
VCL16	funny

A value of 1 is checked, 0 means unchecked. The words at VCL6, VCL9, and VCL12 are not real words and can be used as a validity check.
